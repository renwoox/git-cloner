	2. Enter the name of the owner/author? Ex: `sanumala`
	
	3. Alias name? (Leave empty for default)" Ex: `mygitcloner`

Thats it! Script will clone the repository into current working directory.
Once Clone is successful it will display Okey! message with acutal git command it used to clone the repository.
