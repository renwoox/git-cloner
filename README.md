Simple Shell script to clone the git repository
This script will ask following questions
	1. Enter the name of the git project which you want to clone? Ex: `git-cloner`
	2. Enter the name of the owner/author? Ex: `sanumala`
	3. Alias name? (Leave empty for default)" Ex: `mygitcloner`

Thats it! Script will clone the repository into current working directory.
Once Clone is successful it will display Okey! message with acutal git command it used to clone the repository.

TODO's:
	* Need to add input to accept the directory where user wants to clone
	* Check the existance of the project and warn user if project alaready exists
	* Ask for depth,branch and more specifics about git depth levels and branch user wants to clone
	* And more!
